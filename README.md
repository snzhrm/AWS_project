Project Description:
I built a cloud-based sentiment and emotion analysis pipeline using Reddit posts as a data source. The goal is to extract user emotions from Reddit discussions, clean and transform the data, analyze sentiment and emotion with machine learning models, and visualize it via dashboards in Amazon QuickSight.
